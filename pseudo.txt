Functionality
    - when the pictures are rendered on the page they are done so in random order
    - each time on of the pictures is clicked, a setState function is called so
    that the order of images is rearranged.
    - when the same picture gets clicked a second time, the score is reset and the
    game starts over with all pictures' clicked values set to false.

    I will call the shuffleArray(data).map() function in the render() function
    so that the order is shuffled each time the page is rendered.
